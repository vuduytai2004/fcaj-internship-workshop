We will create a symmetric Customer Managed Key to encrypt all data in S3, DynamoDB, and Secrets Manager.

3. Configure key:
   * **Key type**: Select **Symmetric** (Symmetric key - required for the architecture).
   * **Key usage**: Select **Encrypt and decrypt**.
   * Click **Next**.

4. Add labels:
   * **Alias**: Enter exactly `docuflow-dev-main-key` (The system will automatically add the prefix `alias/` to make it `alias/docuflow-dev-main-key`).


   * **Description**: Enter: `CMK KMS Key for DocuFlow AI project to encrypt S3 buckets, DynamoDB, and Secrets Manager.`

   * Click **Next**.


5. Define Key Administrative Permissions:
   * From the User/Role list, check your account name (or your Administrator role) to designate the person with permission to delete/edit this key.

   * **Key deletion**: Check **Allow key administrators to delete this key** (Allows key deletion when the project finishes).

   * Click **Next**.


6. Define Key Usage Permissions:
   * This step is extremely important. You must grant permissions to the core services and the IAM Roles you created so they can use this key to encrypt/decrypt data.
   * From the list, check all the Lambda and Step Functions IAM Roles you created in the previous step (from Role 1 to Role 9, for example: `docuflow-dev-ai-textract-lambda-role`, `docuflow-dev-workflow-stepfunctions-role`,...).
