We will securely store and encrypt the access key (API Key) of the External AI using the AWS Secrets Manager service. This secret key will be encrypted with the project's KMS Key, and only the AI Proxy Lambda function will have permission to retrieve its value.

### Prepare the External AI API Key

Before creating the AWS secret, you need an API key from the LLM provider. In this workshop, the AI Proxy Lambda code calls the OpenAI API at `/v1/chat/completions` and uses `gpt-4o` as the default model.

1. Open [OpenAI API keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), then sign in or create an OpenAI Platform account if you do not have one.
2. Select the Project used for this workshop, or create a dedicated Project such as `docuflow-ai-workshop`.
3. Create a new secret key and give it a recognizable name, such as `docuflow-dev-ai-proxy`.
4. Copy the API key immediately after it is created. OpenAI only shows the full secret key at creation time; if you lose it, create a new key and update the AWS secret.
5. Confirm that your OpenAI Platform account has suitable billing/quota and that the model you plan to use is available. If you do not use `gpt-4o`, record the model name so you can configure the `OPENAI_MODEL` environment variable in the AI Proxy Lambda step.

Do not put the API key in the frontend, GitHub, public `.env` files, or screenshots. In this workshop, the API key is pasted only into AWS Secrets Manager with the key name `api_key`.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Create a new Secret**:
   * In the AWS Console search bar, type **Secrets Manager** ➔ Select the corresponding service.

   * Click the **Store a new secret** button.
   * **Choose secret type**: Select **Other type of secret**.

2. **Configure Key/value pairs**:
   * Left box (**Key**): Enter `api_key` (lowercase, no spaces, standard for the project code).
   * Right box (**Value**): Paste your External AI's Token / API Key.
   * **Encryption key**: Click the dropdown menu and select the correct project KMS key: `alias/docuflow-dev-main-key` (Do not use the default `aws/secretsmanager` key to ensure maximum information security standards).

   * Click **Next**.


3. **Set secret name and description**:
   * **Secret name**: Enter exactly `docuflow-dev-external-ai-api-key`.

   * **Description**: `Stores API Key for External AI normalization integration used exclusively by AI Proxy Lambda.`

   * Keep other settings as default, click **Next** ➔ Skip Rotation configuration and click **Next** ➔ Click **Store** at the bottom to finish.

4. **Record the Secret ARN**:
   * After saving, click on the name of the newly created Secret.
   * Copy its **Secret ARN** string (Example: `arn:aws:secretsmanager:ap-southeast-1:<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>:secret:docuflow-dev-external-ai-api-key-XXXXXX`).

5. **Grant exclusive permissions solely to AI Proxy Lambda (Security Checkpoint)**:
   * To correctly configure your Lambda to read this secret, configure the IAM Policy as follows:
     1. Go to the **IAM** service ➔ **Policies** ➔ `docuflow-dev-ai-secret-read-policy` ➔ Select the **JSON** tab ➔ **Edit**.
     2. Delete the old code and paste the following "least privilege" JSON block (Replace with your secret ARN string in the Resource section if you want absolute security, or keep the `*` at the end as below):

     3. Click **Next**, then select **Save changes**.
