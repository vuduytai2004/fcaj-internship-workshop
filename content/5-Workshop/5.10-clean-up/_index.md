### 1. Goal
Clean up and delete all deployed AWS resources after the workshop to avoid unwanted charges and verify solid project cost control.

### 2. Steps

#### Step 1: Empty and Delete Amazon S3 Buckets
AWS does not allow S3 buckets to be deleted if they contain objects. We must empty them first:
1. In the **S3 Console**, complete the following for all three buckets:
   * `docuflow-dev-raw-<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>-ap-southeast-1`
   * `docuflow-dev-processed-<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>-ap-southeast-1`
   * `docuflow-dev-cloudtrail-logs-<RANDOM_STRING>`
2. For each bucket, select the checkbox next to its name -> Click **Empty** -> Type `permanently delete` to confirm.

3. Once empty, select the bucket -> Click **Delete** -> Type the name of the bucket to delete it permanently.

### 3. Expected Result
* All billable AWS resources are deleted.
* Verification steps ensure no lingering charges accumulate post-workshop.

### 4. Evidence

- Confirm that the workshop S3 buckets no longer appear in the S3 console.
- Confirm that all project resources listed above have been deleted.
- Review AWS Billing and Cost Explorer after cleanup to detect unexpected remaining usage.
